## Brain games

Brain games is a set of 5 logical games. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to play it again. Games are:
Brain-even. Determining an even number.
Brain-calc. Expressions that need to be calculated.
Brain-gcd. Determination of the greatest common divisor.
Brain-progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
Brain-prime. Determination of a prime number.
